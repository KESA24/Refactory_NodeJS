# Hello World - Node Js project
We started our nodeJS practice with creating our first project "Hello World", we followed a guide/tutorial https://wsvincent.com/javascript-express-hello-world/.
We initialised npm(Node Package Manager) in the project to create our package.json file, created a start script and added the express library as a dependency using the "npm install express" command.
We learnt how to use pug instead of html
